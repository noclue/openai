The overall task is to add content to the README.md file of an OSS project with Go bindings and cli for the OpenAI API for newly added support of `moderations` and `models` APIs. There are two sub tasks. First enhance the introduction section to list that listing of models is avaialble as well as ability to use OpenAI models to moderate texts. The second subtask is to add examples for listing models and moderating text to the `Examples` section. Example for text moderation is `go run cmd/openai.go moderation -i "Would you come over to have coffee together?"` and example for listing models is `go run cmd/openai.go models`.
