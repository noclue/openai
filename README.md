# openai

Welcome to the openai project! This project uses the OpenAI API to generate images based on creative prompts. The code for this project was largely written by AI using GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions in the [OpenAI API guide](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to obtain an API key and set it in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Then, clone this repository and run the following command:

```
go run cmd/openai/openai.go help image image create "Pretty woman walking down the street."
```

This will generate an image based on the provided prompt.
