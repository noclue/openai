# openai-experiments

Welcome to the openai-experiments project! This project is written in Golang and uses GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to generate creative prompts and responses.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following command:
```
go run ./cmd/generate.go --prompt "Create a Times magazine cover featuring a lunar tomato farmer with the Earth in the background. The farmer should be shown picking tomatoes on the moon, with the Earth visible in the distance. The cover should have the title "The Future of Farming: The First Tomato Farmer on the Moon" in bold, eye-catching letters. The cover should convey a sense of excitement and possibility, as the farmer represents the next step in humanity's journey to explore and thrive in the universe."
```

This will generate a response based on the provided prompt.
